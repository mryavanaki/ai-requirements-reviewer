Title: Gift Card Redemption in E-commerce Checkout

Description:
The system should allow customers to redeem gift cards during the checkout process on the website or mobile app.

Functional Requirements:
1. The user should be able to enter a valid gift card number in the “Apply Gift Card” section during checkout.
2. The system must validate the gift card against the existing gift card database to ensure it is active and has sufficient balance.
3. If the card is valid, the balance should be applied to the total order amount, reducing the final payable amount.
4. The system should display a confirmation message showing the gift card balance used and the remaining payable amount.
5. The system should support partial redemption — any remaining balance should stay in the gift card for future use.
6. The system must log all gift card redemptions for auditing purposes.

Assumptions:
- Gift cards are issued only in INR.
- A user can apply only one gift card per transaction.

Constraints:
- The feature must be implemented within the existing checkout microservice.
- The API should reuse the existing payment validation interface.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- The validation API must respond within 2 seconds.
- The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent gift card validations.
- All card numbers and transactions must be encrypted in transit and at rest.

Open Questions:
- Should users be allowed to redeem expired cards if they are reactivated by customer support?
- What happens if the gift card API is temporarily unavailable during checkout?
